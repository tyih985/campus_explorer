# UBC Campus Explorer Project Repository
## Configuring your environment
To start using this project, you need to get your development environment configured so that you can build and execute the code.
To do this, follow these steps; the specifics of each step will vary based on your operating system:
1. [Install git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (v2.X). You should be able to execute `git --version` on the command line after installation is complete.
2. [Install Node (Current)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (Current: v23.X), which will also install NPM (you should be able to execute `node --version` and `npm --version` on the command line).
3. [Install Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) (1.22.X). You should be able to execute `yarn --version`.
